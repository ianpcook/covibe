# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for packaging the existing Covibe Agent Personality System as a VS Code extension. The goal is to create a native VS Code extension that can be distributed through the VS Code Marketplace, implementing core functionality directly in TypeScript while leveraging VS Code's built-in UI components and APIs.

The extension will provide the same core functionality - allowing users to configure AI coding assistant personalities - but with a streamlined architecture that prioritizes performance, security, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Marketplace Distribution

**User Story:** As a developer using VS Code with AI coding assistants, I want to install a Covibe extension from the marketplace so that I can easily configure personality traits for my AI assistant without leaving my IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for "Covibe" in the VS Code Extensions marketplace THEN the extension SHALL appear in search results with proper metadata
2. WHEN a user clicks "Install" on the Covibe extension THEN the extension SHALL install successfully with size under 10MB
3. WHEN the extension is activated THEN it SHALL start within 200ms using lazy activation events
4. WHEN the extension loads THEN it SHALL display a welcome view with quick start actions
5. WHEN installing on any platform THEN the extension SHALL work without platform-specific dependencies

### Requirement 2: Native VS Code Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access Covibe functionality through VS Code's native UI elements so that the experience feels integrated and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is active THEN it SHALL add a "Covibe" view container to the Activity Bar
2. WHEN I click the Covibe activity bar icon THEN it SHALL open a tree view with personality list
3. WHEN I use the Command Palette THEN it SHALL include Covibe commands prefixed with "Covibe:"
4. WHEN I access Covibe settings THEN they SHALL appear in VS Code's Settings UI under "Extensions > Covibe"
5. WHEN I need to select options THEN the extension SHALL use Quick Pick UI instead of custom webviews

### Requirement 3: Personality Management (MVP)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and manage AI personalities directly within VS Code using simple, native interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I invoke "Create Personality" command THEN it SHALL use VS Code's InputBox for description
2. WHEN researching a personality THEN it SHALL show progress using VS Code's Progress API
3. WHEN viewing personalities THEN they SHALL appear in a TreeView with inline actions
4. WHEN activating a personality THEN it SHALL update workspace files with confirmation dialog
5. WHEN editing a personality THEN it SHALL use VS Code's built-in text editor

### Requirement 4: Workspace Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to respect VS Code workspace boundaries and trust settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension activates THEN it SHALL only scan the current workspace for AI IDE files
2. WHEN in an untrusted workspace THEN it SHALL operate in restricted mode without file modifications
3. WHEN workspace contains AI IDE files THEN they SHALL appear in the Explorer with decorations
4. WHEN switching workspaces THEN the extension SHALL maintain separate personality states
5. WHEN multi-root workspace is open THEN it SHALL handle each root independently

### Requirement 5: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure my personality configurations and workspace data remain secure and private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN it SHALL use VS Code's SecretStorage API
2. WHEN making network requests THEN they SHALL use HTTPS with certificate validation
3. WHEN handling user input THEN it SHALL be sanitized to prevent injection attacks
4. WHEN collecting telemetry THEN it SHALL respect VS Code's telemetry settings
5. WHEN in restricted mode THEN network features SHALL be disabled

### Requirement 6: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to be fast, lightweight, and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extension activates THEN startup time SHALL be under 200ms
2. WHEN performing operations THEN memory usage SHALL stay under 50MB
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with actionable recovery steps
4. WHEN operations fail THEN the extension SHALL gracefully degrade functionality
5. WHEN VS Code updates THEN the extension SHALL remain compatible

### Requirement 7: Progressive Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to basic features immediately with advanced features available as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN first installed THEN core features SHALL work without configuration
2. WHEN advanced features are needed THEN they SHALL be enabled through settings
3. WHEN offline THEN basic template-based personalities SHALL remain available
4. WHEN online THEN enhanced AI research features SHALL become active
5. WHEN features are experimental THEN they SHALL be clearly marked in settings

### Requirement 8: Data Portability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export and share personality configurations with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting a personality THEN it SHALL create a JSON file with standard schema
2. WHEN importing a personality THEN it SHALL validate the schema before applying
3. WHEN sharing via settings sync THEN personalities SHALL sync across devices
4. WHEN exporting all personalities THEN it SHALL create a single backup file
5. WHEN importing fails THEN it SHALL provide detailed validation errors

### Requirement 9: Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback and helpful documentation while using the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are running THEN progress SHALL be shown in status bar
2. WHEN errors occur THEN notifications SHALL include "Learn More" actions
3. WHEN using features THEN contextual help SHALL be available via hover
4. WHEN stuck THEN walkthrough guides SHALL be accessible from welcome view
5. WHEN reporting issues THEN diagnostic information SHALL be easily collected

### Requirement 10: Extension Lifecycle

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle updates and migrations smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extension updates THEN user data SHALL be automatically migrated
2. WHEN breaking changes occur THEN users SHALL see a migration guide
3. WHEN settings change THEN old settings SHALL map to new equivalents
4. WHEN uninstalling THEN user SHALL be prompted to backup configurations
5. WHEN pre-release versions available THEN users SHALL can opt-in to testing
