# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The IDE Export System extends the existing Agent Personality System by providing web-based export functionality that allows users to download personality configurations in IDE-specific formats. Users can generate properly formatted configuration files for their preferred IDE and receive clear instructions on where to place these files in their projects, enabling seamless integration without requiring direct file system access from the web application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export personality configurations from the web app in my IDE's format, so that I can manually integrate them into my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a personality configuration in the web app THEN the system SHALL display "Download for IDE" options
2. WHEN a user selects an IDE type for export THEN the system SHALL generate the configuration in the correct format for that IDE
3. WHEN a configuration is generated THEN the system SHALL provide the file as a downloadable resource
4. WHEN multiple IDE formats are available THEN the system SHALL display all supported options (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf, VS Code, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive clear instructions on where to place downloaded configuration files, so that I can properly integrate them into my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user downloads a configuration file THEN the system SHALL display placement instructions specific to the selected IDE
2. WHEN showing placement instructions THEN the system SHALL include the exact file path relative to the project root
3. WHEN providing instructions THEN the system SHALL include any necessary folder creation steps
4. WHEN instructions are displayed THEN the system SHALL show examples of correct file placement

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview configuration files before downloading, so that I can verify the content is correct for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an IDE for export THEN the system SHALL provide a preview of the generated configuration file
2. WHEN showing a preview THEN the system SHALL display the exact content that will be downloaded
3. WHEN previewing content THEN the system SHALL use syntax highlighting appropriate for the file format
4. WHEN a preview is shown THEN the system SHALL allow the user to proceed with download or cancel

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize export settings for different IDEs, so that I can tailor the configuration to my specific setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting for an IDE THEN the system SHALL allow customization of format-specific options
2. WHEN customizing Cursor exports THEN the system SHALL allow selection of rule file names and directory structure
3. WHEN customizing Claude exports THEN the system SHALL allow choice between CLAUDE.md and custom file names
4. WHEN customizing any export THEN the system SHALL preserve the core personality configuration while adapting format details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export multiple personality configurations at once, so that I can set up different personalities for different projects efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple personalities are selected THEN the system SHALL allow bulk export operations
2. WHEN performing bulk export THEN the system SHALL generate a zip file containing all selected configurations
3. WHEN creating bulk exports THEN the system SHALL organize files by IDE type and personality name
4. WHEN bulk exporting THEN the system SHALL include a README file with placement instructions for all included configurations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the exported files to include metadata about their generation, so that I can track and manage my personality configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating export files THEN the system SHALL include generation timestamps and version information
2. WHEN files are LLM-generated THEN the system SHALL include AI analysis metadata (provider, confidence, etc.)
3. WHEN exporting configurations THEN the system SHALL include source information and personality research details
4. WHEN metadata is included THEN the system SHALL format it appropriately for each IDE's comment style

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to re-import exported configurations back into the web app, so that I can share and backup my personality setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a previously exported file THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the configuration
2. WHEN importing configurations THEN the system SHALL extract personality data from IDE-specific formats
3. WHEN import is successful THEN the system SHALL recreate the personality configuration in the web app
4. IF import fails due to format issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access export functionality through the API, so that I can integrate it into my development workflows and scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests for export THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful endpoints for configuration export
2. WHEN requesting exports via API THEN the system SHALL support all IDE formats available in the web interface
3. WHEN API exports are requested THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted file content with appropriate headers
4. WHEN using API export THEN the system SHALL support both single configuration and bulk export operations
