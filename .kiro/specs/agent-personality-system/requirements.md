# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agent Personality System is a tool that enhances existing coding agents by adding configurable personality traits to their responses. The system accepts personality descriptions from users through multiple interfaces (web, API, chat), researches the requested personality type, and generates contextual prompts that can be integrated into various IDE environments to influence how coding agents respond to users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify a personality type for my coding agent through a web interface, so that I can customize the interaction style to match my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a form to input personality descriptions
2. WHEN a user submits a personality description THEN the system SHALL accept text describing celebrities, authors, fictional characters, or character archetypes
3. WHEN a user submits a valid personality request THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback confirming the request was received
4. IF the personality description is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to request personality configurations through an API, so that I can integrate the system into my existing development workflows and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes an API request with personality data THEN the system SHALL accept RESTful API calls
2. WHEN an API request is received THEN the system SHALL validate the request format and respond with appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN a valid API request is processed THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON responses containing the generated personality context
4. IF an API request is malformed THEN the system SHALL return error responses with clear descriptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the personality system through chat interfaces, so that I can configure agent personalities conversationally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a chat message requesting a personality THEN the system SHALL parse natural language personality requests
2. WHEN processing chat input THEN the system SHALL support conversational refinement of personality traits
3. WHEN a chat session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain context across multiple messages
4. WHEN a personality is configured via chat THEN the system SHALL confirm the configuration in natural language

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to research personality information automatically, so that I don't have to provide detailed personality traits myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a personality type is submitted THEN the system SHALL search for relevant information about the specified personality
2. WHEN researching celebrities or public figures THEN the system SHALL gather information about their communication style, mannerisms, and notable characteristics
3. WHEN researching fictional characters THEN the system SHALL collect data about their personality traits, speech patterns, and behavioral tendencies
4. WHEN researching character archetypes THEN the system SHALL identify common traits associated with the archetype (cowboy, robot, drill sergeant, etc.)
5. IF insufficient information is found THEN the system SHALL request clarification or suggest similar alternatives

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate contextual prompts that work with my IDE, so that my coding agent can adopt the requested personality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN personality research is complete THEN the system SHALL generate structured context that can be fed to LLMs
2. WHEN generating context THEN the system SHALL create prompts that influence response style while maintaining technical accuracy
3. WHEN context is generated THEN the system SHALL format the output to be compatible with coding agent systems
4. WHEN creating prompts THEN the system SHALL ensure the personality enhancement doesn't interfere with code functionality or accuracy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to persist personality configurations in my IDE, so that the settings are maintained across development sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a personality configuration is finalized THEN the system SHALL detect the user's IDE environment
2. WHEN writing to Cursor projects THEN the system SHALL create files in the `/cursor/rules/` directory with `.mdc` extension
3. WHEN writing to Claude projects THEN the system SHALL create or update a `CLAUDE.md` file in the project root
4. WHEN writing to Windsurf projects THEN the system SHALL create or update a `.windsurf` file in the project root
5. WHEN the IDE type cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL provide multiple format options for manual integration
6. IF file writing fails THEN the system SHALL provide the generated content for manual copying

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to modify or remove personality configurations, so that I can adjust the agent behavior as my needs change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests personality modification THEN the system SHALL allow editing of existing configurations
2. WHEN a user wants to remove a personality THEN the system SHALL provide options to reset to default behavior
3. WHEN configurations are updated THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding IDE files
4. WHEN multiple personalities are configured THEN the system SHALL allow switching between different personality profiles

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle various personality input formats, so that I can describe personalities in natural, flexible ways.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users input personality descriptions THEN the system SHALL accept free-form text descriptions
2. WHEN processing input THEN the system SHALL handle specific names (e.g., "Sherlock Holmes", "Einstein", "Yoda")
3. WHEN processing input THEN the system SHALL handle descriptive phrases (e.g., "friendly mentor", "sarcastic genius", "patient teacher")
4. WHEN processing input THEN the system SHALL handle combination requests (e.g., "like Tony Stark but more patient")
5. IF the input is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to refine the personality request
