# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LLM-Driven Research System enhances the existing personality research functionality by replacing hardcoded personality mappings with dynamic LLM-based personality analysis. The system accepts free-form personality descriptions, processes them through a configurable LLM prompt, and generates structured personality profiles that can be formatted for various IDE environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to dynamically analyze personality descriptions using an LLM, so that I'm not limited to predefined personality mappings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a personality description THEN the system SHALL send the description to an LLM for analysis
2. WHEN processing personality descriptions THEN the system SHALL NOT rely on hardcoded personality mappings
3. WHEN the LLM processes a description THEN the system SHALL receive structured personality data
4. IF the LLM analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or error handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the LLM prompt used for personality analysis, so that I can optimize the research quality and test different approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to query the LLM THEN it SHALL load the prompt from a configurable file
2. WHEN the prompt file is updated THEN the system SHALL use the new prompt without requiring code changes
3. WHEN the prompt file is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL use a default prompt and log a warning
4. WHEN multiple prompt variations exist THEN the system SHALL allow selection of different prompt files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LLM response to be structured and validated, so that the personality data is consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM returns a response THEN the system SHALL validate it against Pydantic models
2. WHEN the response structure is invalid THEN the system SHALL request a corrected response or handle the error gracefully
3. WHEN the response is valid THEN the system SHALL convert it to internal personality profile format
4. WHEN validation fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the personality profiles to be formatted appropriately for my IDE, so that the generated context works seamlessly with my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a personality profile is generated THEN the system SHALL detect the target IDE environment
2. WHEN formatting for Cursor THEN the system SHALL create appropriate .mdc files in /cursor/rules/
3. WHEN formatting for Claude THEN the system SHALL create or update CLAUDE.md files
4. WHEN formatting for Windsurf THEN the system SHALL create or update .windsurf files
5. WHEN the IDE cannot be detected THEN the system SHALL provide multiple format options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the research process to maintain existing functionality, so that current workflows are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new LLM research is implemented THEN existing API endpoints SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN personality configurations are created THEN they SHALL be stored using the existing persistence layer
3. WHEN research fails THEN the system SHALL provide the same error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN the system processes requests THEN response times SHALL be comparable to the current implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LLM integration to be configurable, so that I can use different LLM providers or models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the LLM THEN the system SHALL support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
2. WHEN the LLM provider is changed THEN the system SHALL adapt the request format accordingly
3. WHEN LLM configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN the LLM service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative research methods

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle LLM rate limits and errors gracefully, so that temporary issues don't break the research functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM service returns rate limit errors THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN the LLM service is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue requests or provide fallback responses
3. WHEN LLM responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL attempt to parse partial data or request clarification
4. WHEN multiple LLM errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LLM research to be cost-effective, so that personality analysis doesn't incur excessive API costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making LLM requests THEN the system SHALL implement response caching for similar queries
2. WHEN processing personality descriptions THEN the system SHALL optimize prompt length to minimize token usage
3. WHEN the same personality is requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL return cached results
4. WHEN LLM costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide warnings or fallback to free alternatives
